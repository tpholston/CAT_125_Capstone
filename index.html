          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Welcome to my website where you can learn all about democratic workplace initiatives around the world! From
            learning about the success stories of Mondragon, to starting a cooperative in your community, or even
            finding employment in a cooperative you can do it all here!</p>
          <p>I’m currently a junior attending the University of California, San Diego and I’m pursuing a bachelor’s
            degree in computer science. In my classes, internships, and student interactions, the conventional idea of
            going to a FAANG company was always heavily encouraged. A sort of binary of either making a startup where
            you’re the CEO or working for a big tech company seemed to be the narrative that was pushed almost
            exclusively from my personal experience. I started digging into possible alternatives and stumbled across
            the success story of worker cooperatives as an alternative to conventional employment and ownership.</p>
          <p>gathered a lot of data from lots of different sources (the qualities of which will be detailed in this
            website) and read a lot of material. Although I am most definitely biased towards promoting worker
            cooperatives based on the evidence I have seen, navigating to the links page will have categorized articles
            regarding various metrics of success/failures that I hope to be as unbiased as possible. I put many
            different studies both supporting and against my views but if you have other studies you would like to have
            on the site to give people an even better understanding it is highly encouraged! Reach out to my email:
            jeff.bezos.me@gmail.com.</p>
          <p>I have a section where people can leave their contact information alongside job listings so anyone actively
            looking for cooperative employment can reach out. In the future I may include a looking for employment
            section where people can post their LinkedIn accounts or other points of contact in addition to their
            respective skills. Thanks for checking the site out!</p>

              levels, this isn't supported in research.
              One study (Craig and Pencavel) found that cooperatives may raise productivity by 6 to 14 percent but no
              definitive conclusions could be made
              from this due to a couple factors detailed on page 167. However another more recent study on several
              thousand firms from France found cooperative productivity
              to be the same as or even higher than their conventional counterparts.

            <p class="card-content">Worker co-ops have been shown to choose employment stability over income
              stability.
              Employee members are able to choose to preserve jobs in which they have a say in determining
              working conditions and employment risk, and in which they are likely to be better motivated, more
              creative, and happier. The
              cooperatives may affect public finances and health positively by decreasing unemployment risk both in
              the cooperatives
              themselves and in the community.

          <h1>If they are so successful, then where are they?</h1>
          <p>
            The major critique I hear from proponents of conventional business (particularly David Friedman in <a
              href="https://youtu.be/29qDJHoDStA">this</a> video) is this one and it seems logical enough: "In the
            market businesses compete to survive and grow. If cooperatives are so successful, then why aren't they
            everywhere? Why aren't they dominating the market?". This is a really good question to ask but there are
            a couple things wrong. Let's start by tackling the underlying presupposition which is that growth and size
            is a good metric of success. Endless pursuit of growth isn't necessarily something we should be striving for
            as a society and I think the climate crisis is the best argument in support of this. In an economy that
            promotes
            growth and profitability over the wellbeing of people we have seen and will continue to see the
            ramifications of
            rampant externalities. Although a worker cooperative doesn't necessarily tackle this externality issue, it
            does
            provide companies that put profitability secondary to the needs of workers. In the case of one of the
            largest worker
            cooperatives in the world, Mondragon, during a major economic downturn in the Spanish economy they
            demonstrated a deep
            commitment to the continuation of employment for its members. This is just one example. Many studies have
            demonstrated
            that while conventional firms tend to adjust employment during periods of economic turmoil, cooperatives
            tend to adjust
            pay more than employment ("Good Sustainable Jobs in the Community" link). So, while we may not see many
            Google or Amazon
            sized cooperatives, maybe that isn't the metric we should be going off of. Now even if you're not convinced
            by that, maybe
            you don't believe in climate change, or you just don't care, the reality is that most corporations are very
            small. Among the
            firms that have at least one employee, around 90 per cent have less than 20 employees in the UK (93.7
            percent) the US
            (89.6 percent) and France (90.4 percent) and less than 10 employees in Spain. Large firms are very rare.
            Only 0.3 percent
            of the firms that have employees have 500 employees or more in the UK and the US, 0.2 percent in France and
            0.1 percent in Spain.
            Although we always hear about the fortune 500 companies, the reality is most companies are very small. If
            you really want to
            see a cooperative that seems to be really dominating the market though, navigate to the section of this site
            on Mondragon, the
            seventh largest corporation in Spain. This is an extremely successful and big corporation that employs
            thousands. In
            addition, there are many obstacles for cooperatives that conventional businesses don't necessarily have to
            worry about.
            Things like initial investment can be really hard for cooperatives to garnish as a result of liability.
            Cooperatives
            don't have one person who is responsible for investment and as a result, getting loans from banks can be a
            difficult
            hurdle to get over. Gathering the initial capital to start a business is tough but through political action
            (or even
            social action in making these types of unconventional investments more socially acceptable) we can one
            day hope to create easier paths for cooperatives to get off the ground. After all, it seems this would be a
            really good
            investment of funds, as the turnover rate for cooperatives is significantly lower than conventional
            corporations.

          <p>
            Mondragon Corporation is the world's largest worker cooperative as well as the seventh largest company in
            Spain. The corporation was founded by a priest named José María Arizmendiarrieta along with five other
            workers in 1956. When the founders moved to the Mondragon region, it had been neglected for nearly one
            hundred years. There were no employment opportunities, very poor education, and little hope for the future.
            As a result, the cooperative has maintained in it’s core values the importance of grassroot management and
            investment in community action and education.

            Mondragon is a collection of worker co-ops where members democratically and collectively own the
            corporation. The process behind acquiring new members is done through probationary periods. A prospective
            member will be given a period of time where they are overseen by their peers. Subsequently, the prospective
            member’s peers will make a democratic decision alongside the elected board of directors of mondragon to
            determine whether or not this person will become a member. When a person becomes a member they have to pay a
            membership fee to the corporation and are given a vote in what is very similar to a conventional
            corporation’s shareholder meeting. Votes are done to determine rules, policies, and who the company's board
            of directors are. In this way workers play a direct role in not only production but deciding what to do with
            company profits.
          <p>
            The company is highly competitive and is in many markets around the globe employing over 80,000 people
            across 37 countries. Mondragon maintains that the key to it’s massive success is in large part a result of
            the participatory management system. Workers have direct say in the operations of the business and what to
            do with company profits and as a result these profits tend to go towards increasing pay and benefits.
            Cooperatives like Mondragon tend to make less risky investments and as a result continue to be beacons of
            long lasting and stable employment for its members. In a 2008 recession, the Spanish economy was shrinking
            at an annual rate of 1.9%. As a result, Mondragon democratically decided rather than laying workers off like
            many conventional businesses were doing they would implement a worker income drop between 5-10%. Unlike
            other companies where the majority of pay cuts go towards laying off workers while managerial pay tends to
            soar, Mondragon’s managers took the biggest cuts. The wage cuts were implemented in 2009 when most other
            Spanish companies were firing workers to reduce costs (a total of 3.5 million people were added to the
            unemployed during this time).
          </p>
          <p>
            Worker’s enjoy benefits including paid maternity and paternity leave alongside free higher education
            opportunities including their own non-profit university (Mondragon University). Workers have consistently
            seen higher wages in comparison to their conventional counterparts in Spain. Another value of mondragon is
            that of corporate social responsibility to fair distribution of wealth. One of the interesting policies that
            worker cooperatives like Mondragon have historically implemented is the idea of a cap on lowest to highest
            associate pay. No manager within any cooperative can make more than six times the salary of any worker in
            the cooperative. CEO compensation is hundreds of times greater than that of their average employee. In a
            world where income inequality in conventional enterprises iis such a big issue, perhaps following models
            like Mondragon can begin to curb these massive inequities.
